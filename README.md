  Meowly


A web platform that connects adoptable cats with loving homes. Users can browse available cats, learn about their personalities, submit adoption applications, and receive updates on their application status.



Problem Statement
Many stray and abandoned cats are in need of loving homes, but there is a lack of centralized, user-friendly platforms that connect potential adopters with rescue shelters and foster homes. Current solutions are either outdated, cluttered, or limited in functionality. This gap makes it harder for people to discover adoptable cats, and for shelters to efficiently manage listings and applications.

Overview of the Applicationâ€™s Functionality
Meowly is a web-based platform designed to streamline the cat adoption process in Vancouver. The application will allow local shelters and foster parents to create profiles for cats in need of adoption, including pictures, age, breed, personality traits, and health status. Users (potential adopters) will be able to browse available cats, filter results by preferences, and submit an adoption request form directly through the platform. The website will also feature educational resources about responsible cat adoption and care. Shelter administrators will have a dashboard to manage listings and respond to adoption applications efficiently. The goal is to make the adoption process smoother, faster, and more accessible for all users involved.
